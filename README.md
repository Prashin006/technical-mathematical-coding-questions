# Mathematical Problems for Technical Interviews

- This repository covers the mathematical and geometrical questions/problems that can be used to practice for a technical interview

### 1. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
  Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation:
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 89
8^2 + 9^2 = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
4^2 + 2^2 = 20
2^2 + 0^2 = 4
... cycle
```

**TC = O(n)**
**SC = O(n)**
